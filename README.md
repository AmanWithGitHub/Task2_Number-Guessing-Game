# Task 2: Number Guessing Game

This project is a fun and simple number guessing game, developed as a standalone Java console application. It does not require a database and is built entirely on Java's core functionalities.

### **Features**

* **Random Number Generation:** The game automatically generates a random secret number within a range (1 to 100).
* **Interactive Input:** It uses dialogue boxes to prompt the user for their guess.
* **Game Logic:** Provides instant feedback, telling the user if their guess is "too high," "too low," or "correct."
* **Attempt Counter:** Tracks and displays the total number of attempts the user took to guess the correct number.
* **Robustness:** Includes basic error handling to gracefully manage invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric text).

### **Technology Stack**

* **Language:** Java
* **User Interface:** JOptionPane for handling input and output via simple dialogue boxes.
* **Database:** Not required for this standalone application.
